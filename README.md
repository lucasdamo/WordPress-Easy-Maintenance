# WordPress Easy Maintenance
Easily block visitors from seeing your WordPress Blog, but keeping the admin login page and panel.

## Why
It all started when i was playing around with WordPress, i needed a plugin to block visitors from seeing my un-finished website.
After searching for a nice plugin i found a lot of options that were either too complicated to change the main page or it was a paid plugin.
So i decided to create a really simple one, and it was my first plugin ever. 3 years have passed and i found myself needing such a plugin again,
so i decided to use the one i have already created. I am also taking the opportunity to review one of the first plugins i have ever written
and make it open-sourced.
